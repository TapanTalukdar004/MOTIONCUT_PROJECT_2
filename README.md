# Word Counter Project

## Project Overview

The Word Counter project is a simple Python program designed to count the number of words in a given sentence or paragraph. This project helps to strengthen understanding and application of Python programming concepts including user input handling, string manipulation, function creation, control flow, and error handling.

## Project Objectives

- Learn how to take user input in Python.
- Explore string manipulation techniques for text processing.
- Practice creating functions in Python for modular code.
- Implement basic control flow structures to control the program's logic.
- Display the word count as the output of the program.
- Handle potential errors such as empty input.
- Ensure a clear and user-friendly interface for input and output.
- Add comments to explain the purpose of different parts of the code.

## Requirements and Features

- **User Input**: Prompt the user to enter a sentence or paragraph.
- **Word Counting Logic**: Implement a function that counts the number of words in the input.
- **Output Display**: Print the word count to the console.
- **Error Handling**: Account for potential errors, such as empty input.
- **Code Comments**: Add comments to explain the purpose of different parts of your code.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Ensure a clear and user-friendly interface for input and output.
